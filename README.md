# Matrix-Calculator
A simple C++ project that can perform basic matrix functions, RREF, OLS, and QR decomposition into eigenvalues

Credit to the College Board for creating the apmatrix class, an object that is essentially a 2dArray... but worse

# How To Run:
Run main.cpp to begin, user interaction should be intuitive, if not tedious.
